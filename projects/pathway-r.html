  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    PathwayR is a platform that helps professors find and evaluate undergraduate researchers.
    I designed the faculty-facing dashboard with a focus on making applicant comparison fast,
    structured, and human-centered.

  <!-- PROBLEM -->
  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>
    Professors struggle to efficiently review and compare student applicants. Existing tools
    are fragmented, forcing faculty to rely on Excel sheets, notes, and email to track candidates.
    This makes it difficult to evaluate both qualifications and personal fit.
  </p>

  <!-- RESEARCH & INSIGHTS -->
  <h2>Research & Key Insights</h2>
  <p>
    I interviewed two professors to understand how they post roles, review applicants,
    and communicate with students.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Comparing applicants across tabs and documents is time-consuming</li>
    <li>Technical skills matter, but motivation and communication are critical</li>
    <li>Faculty often review and contact students in batches</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Core Insight:</strong><br>
    “Can the student do the work?” → “Do I want to work with this student?”
  </p>

  <h2>Design Strategy</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Structure comparison to reduce cognitive load</li>
    <li>Separate objective screening from human evaluation</li>
    <li>Support fast shortlisting and batch actions</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Student Comparison & Repository</h2>
  <p>
    I designed a saved student repository and pitched a side-by-side comparison view,
    allowing professors to evaluate multiple candidates at once while keeping
    notes and context in one place.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Side-by-side applicant comparison</li>
    <li>Persistent notes for qualitative evaluation</li>
    <li>Quick shortlisting for batch communication</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Visual Design</h2>
  <p>
    The interface uses an 8-point grid, clear hierarchy, and WCAG AA–compliant contrast
    to keep dense academic information readable during long review sessions.
  </p>

  <h2>Outcome</h2>
  <p>
    The project won the PathwayR design competition among 7–8 teams.
    I completed the work independently, from research to final UI,
    and presented it to a panel of two professors and two industry judges
    from Simplii Financial and RBC.
  </p>
  
  
  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    This project reinforced the importance of designing systems that balance efficiency
    with human judgment—especially in academic hiring workflows.
